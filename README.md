# first-javascript-zuri-task
This is my first zuri JavaScript task.
I was asked to asked to write a JavaScript code that will display my Name, Height and country on the screan.
I used Document.write to Display my information.
I also commented a way whereby I can also use "alert" to Display the Information .
