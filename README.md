# first-javascript-zuri-task

Link to my published page: https://josh565565.github.io/first-javascript-zuri-task/ 

This is my first zuri JavaScript task.
I was asked to write a JavaScript code that will display my Name, Height and country on the screan.
I used Document.write to Display my information.
I also commented a way whereby I can also use "alert" to Display the Information.

I wrote my JavaScript code inside my HTML file.
I can also write my JavaScript code in as saperate JS file but since this is an Introduction task 
That's why i decided to write the code inside my HTML file.
